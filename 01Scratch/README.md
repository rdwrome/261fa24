## Before you Code

### Pseudocode
- Break down the way to solve to problem into the smallest tasks possible, but in the language you speak to yourself
- Think like a computer, be literal! Algorithmic thinking!

### Simon Says Pseudocode Share and Pair
- Imagine we are each a dancing machine.
- Give us precise instructions for a simple dance using at least one function, at least one condition, and at least one loop.
- I'll do it if you don't want but I'll be tough!

## While you Code

### Pseudocode to start

### Code Reuse
- Stand on the shoulders of giants
- Be a good collaborator

### Always be Documenting
- Documentation outline in the syllabus

## Tower of Babel (Review of Reading)

### Stack vs. Heap Review
- Stack: part of the RAM that remembers variable and function definitions
- Heap: part of the RAM that remembers data types like lists at an address

**IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY DONE SO IN CLASS**
- Set up a GitHub.com account with a simple username you can use professionally
- Follow [me](https://github.com/rdwrome)
- Accept my invitation to join the class private repository
- Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

- Read over the syllabus. Bring any questions you have to the next class.

- In GitHub Desktop, go to File > Clone Repository and clone the class repository (261)
- Setup GitHub/save the local file path (where the files are on your computer) somewhere you can easily find the files (i.e. Documents, Desktop NOT iCloud!)
- Go to File > New repository
- Create a new repository called "itp"
- Check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README" and check again that your local file path goes somewhere you can easily find; let the repository stay public (for now)
- Your new repository will appear in the far left bar of the GitHub Desktop window.
- Click on the repository and then select "Publish this repository to GitHub"
- When that has gone through go to Repository > Open in Pulsar
- The README.md file of the repository you created for this class will open in Pulsar
