## Scratch

1. Implement a Scratch project with the following requirements:
	- Use at least two sprites (please, for my sake, no cats).
	- Have at least three scripts or threads total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
	- Must use at least one condition or one loop.
	- Must use at least one variable.
	- Must use at least one sound.

2. Save the project as an .sb3 file (you must be signed into the scratch website in order to do this!) into the Scratch folder we made in your itp repo this week.

3. Use the README.md file in the same Scratch subfolder to document your process following the DOCUMENTATION OUTLINE in the syllabus.

4. Save all changes and push them using GitHubDesktop up to GitHub.com. Take the link to the Scratch subfolder in your itp repo and put it in the Scratch Assignment in Canvas.
