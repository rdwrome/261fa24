# LMCS-261: Introduction to Computer Programming

Welcome, Programmers!

## Description
In this course, students learn the fundamentals of computer programing that serve as a foundation for developing software applications and further exploration of programming languages. Instead of focusing on a single language or platform, this course prepares students to understand computer code in general and to understand the role computers can play in solving real-world and creative problems. By recognizing the concepts that are universal in computer programming, students are better prepared to understand any codes they come across, providing them with advanced problem-solving skills that are important when adapting to different languages based on specific situations. The logical thinking and technical skills students learn in this course can be used to develop a wide range of practical applications on the web, and in game, software, and product development. [Based on this course.](https://github.com/LMSC-261/LMSC-261) Because Berklee is an Apple institution, software applications are used with MacOS.
This is an introductory survey course of Python, HTML, JavaScript, and SQL.

**Total**|**100%**

### ALL DUE DATES ARE IN CANVAS

### Steps to submit via GitHub+Canvas
  1. Make a subfolder in *your* GitHub repository named after the assignment (i.e. {yourusername}/itp/scratch, etc.)
  2. Commit all parts of your assignment (i.e. code+documentation) into that subfolder
  3. Submit the link for that folder into the appropriate Canvas Assignment

### Documentation outline
  - The documentation (**always** in Markdown as a .md file) must have the following:
    - what you did
    - how you did it
    - the problems you faced (ABDYD: always be documenting your debugging!)
    - how you overcame them
    - *what code you used from others/elsewhere*
      - where to find that code (specific links!!!)
      - other folks' GitHub public repositories and [Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are the best places to go for help most of the time
      - *do not* submit paywalled links
      - *if* you submit YouTube links (which is discouraged), they must have TIME STAMPS
    - Correctly document all your debugging, especially if you code ultimately does not run as intended. I will take points off for code that does not run correctly, but will still give partial credit if it is well-documented.
    - For the purposes of this class, your documentation also helps you prepare to talk about your code in class with your colleagues.
    - In general (unless I specify otherwise), it is permissible to use chat-GPT under the following circumstances:
      - You put your entire prompt in your Documentation File.
      - You include a screenshot of your interaction with chat-GPT in your Documentation File.
      - You write out *in your own words* your understanding of what you learned from using chat-GPT.

## Policies
### Communication
- This is an equitable learning environment.
	- Problem-solve constructively with respectful language;
	- Be patient with yourselves and others (especially when mistakes are made);
	- Never posture/pose/attitudinize;
	- Always speak up and admit when you do not understand something.
- When you email me, please let me know what class/section you're in.
- The best way to communicate with me outside of class is *always* to make an appointment with me in my office hour.
- If you'd like constructive criticism on music, I'm happy to give that in my office hour in real-time. I won't give feedback on recordings via email.
- I don't answer emails that can be answered with a one-step Google search (i.e. “How do I change the timezone on my Google Calendar?”).
- I don't necessarily answer emails outside of working hours (M-F, 9-5)
- I don't answer emails when the answer can be found in the syllabus (here).
- In an emergency, please call me (really).

### Grading
- Assignment extensions are granted more than 12 hours in advance, and will not be granted for the midterm or final.
- You will be held to the Berklee Policy on Honesty in Academic Work (see Student Handbook).
- Late assignments are not accepted.
- If you have a question or comment about a grade, you must come ask it *in person* at my office hour.

### Attendance
- The **(two)** lowest attendance grades will be dropped.
- Remote attendance is not permitted.
- You must attend class with the computer you're using for class projects (no phones, no tablets, no borrowed laptops). If you do not, you'll receive a partial attendance grade for the week.
